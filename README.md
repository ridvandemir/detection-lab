# detection_lab

Objective

The detection_lab project aimed to establish a environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The main focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Splunk. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM and practical application.
- Analyzing network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures.
- Knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

Tools Used

- Splunk for log ingestion and analysis.
- Splunk Universal Forwarder and Sysmon for log collecting/forwarding
- Kali Linux/Metasploit to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
